I wrote a blog post showing and talking about the rise of opioid death. 

It can be found [here on Medium](https://medium.com/@ethan.skamarock/will-there-ever-be-change-to-this-epidemic-3c4ae69a30ba/ "Medium Blog Post")

It covers how much it is increasing, some of the reasons that the problem exists in the first place, 
and some potential steps we can take towards solving the problem
