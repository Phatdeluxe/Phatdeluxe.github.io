## Learning how to use python, and how it applies to data science

I am learning how to code in python, and how it applies to data science.

So far we have covered how to use Pandas to import .csv files, clean the data, then manipulate it to organize the information we want.

Presently, I am working on compiling data about opioid and opiate deaths in The United States from 1999 to 2019. 

The struggles I am facing with this project is how the data is organized when I get it. So far I have found total deaths due to drug overdoese, but this includes all drugs, and is not specific to opioids and opiates.

Hopefuilly by the begining of next week I will have a polished rough draft.
