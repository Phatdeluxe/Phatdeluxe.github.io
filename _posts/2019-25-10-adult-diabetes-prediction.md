## Predictive modeling project

For the last month I have been working to make a model that predicts the percentage of adults with diabetes for a given US county. 

If you want to learn more about the model, I made an app for demonstration purposes
You can find the app [here on Heroku](http://adult-diabetes-predictor.herokuapp.com/)

I also wrote a blog post about some of the insights I learned in the process of making the model.
