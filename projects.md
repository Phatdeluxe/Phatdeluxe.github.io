# Predictive Models

### Med Cabinet Strain Recommender



### Adult Diabetes Predictor

Using an XGBoosted regressor, trained a model to predict the % of adults with diabetes.
A toy app of the model can be found [here on Heroku](http://adult-diabetes-predictor.herokuapp.com/).
A blog post I wrote about the work can be found [here on Medium](https://medium.com/@ethan.skamarock/can-changes-be-made-to-reduce-diabetes-26e9237a7673?source=friends_link&sk=e1b5a6c2a42e4362dbc5a3d9d69e6ade).

# Data Exploration

### Drug abuse data storytelling project

Looked through the CDC's Multiple Cause of Death (Detailed Mortality) and found some disturbing statistics
A blog post can be found [here on medium](https://medium.com/@ethan.skamarock/will-there-ever-be-change-to-this-epidemic-3c4ae69a30ba).

# App Creation

### Med-Cabinet Strain Recommender

Worked on a team to create a python backend that took a bunch text, used NLP to create a prediction, and returned Medical Marijuana strain recommendations.

I worked on creating an SQlite database with all the strain information and taking the prediction, querying the database, and returning the strain information in a JSON object for the front end.
